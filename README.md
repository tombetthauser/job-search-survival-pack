# Tom's Job Search Survival Pack

Just some links I wish I had in one place when I graduated from bootcamp and entered my job search. None of this should take priority over the guidance of your job coach, nor should it be interpreted as a comprehensive list of the resources you will need during your job search in any way. That said hopefully some of its helpful, I'll keep adding to it when new resources become available.

Get that money and make the world a better place everybody, you're engineers now!

<!-- No matter how comfortable you are building out a fullstack web application, it's always hard to get started on a new one after a few months. These are the project starters from modules 4, 5 and 6. They can be referenced to start a new project or potentially to help clean up an existing project. Trying to do a 1 or 2 day speed build of a minimal non-portfolio project can be a great idea to stay sharp as well.

Please note that there is not a link to a completed Authenticate Me solution. This is unfortunately necessary as the solution is not a publically accessible resource from curriculum. That said if you build it out again save it as a generic solution! -->

## Leetcode Starter List

These questions represent a challenging but doable list that covers a full range of subjects and difficulty levels encountered in algorithm-focused technical interviews. Generic youtube links are provided as a reminder that youtube is often a good resource in conjunction with the `discussion section` provided by leetcode.

[How to use Leetcode without Hating Leetcode (youtube)](https://youtu.be/SqT6pNTCPXE)

When using leetcode try not to be intimidated by the sometimes very academic problem descriptions or the often unintuitive repl. If you feel lost click the `Run Code` button at the bottom right of the page and then freely play around with the inputs under the `Testcase` tab above the bottom right section. Experiment until you understand what the question is asking. The youtube links are also fair game for problem clarification.

## Express Project Faker Workaround

```javascript
// Faker is no longer supported, you will need to accommodate for coep errors by using the following in your backend app.js, this will allow 3rd party or http images to display.

app.use(helmet.crossOriginResourcePolicy({ policy: "cross-origin" }));
```

```bash
# Also you may need to npm install -g create-react-app first, if you are going to use the template.
# Open a terminal and change the directory until you are in the directory where you want to create your React app.
# To begin, install a global version of create-react-app:

npm i -g create-react-app

# You only need to install create-react-app on your computer once, i.e., not before every project.
# Although the official create-react-app documentation no longer recommends installing a global version of create-react-app, App Academy still recommends that you install it globally. This is because App Academy also encourages you to use nvm (Node Version Manager) to manage versions of Node.js. If you run npx create-react-app (see below) without having first installed create-react-app globally, then nvm will cache the version that you run. This cached version effectively gets treated as a global installation, but, because it is hidden by nvm, it is a global installation that is difficult to find and update. Accordingly, when new create-react-app releases appear, the cached version can cause hard-to-resolve version conflicts that will prevent create-react-app from running. A true global version, in contrast, can be updated simply by re-running the npm installation command.
# TL;DR: Installing create-react-app globally enables you to easily update and maintain the create-react-app version that you are using with nvm.
```
